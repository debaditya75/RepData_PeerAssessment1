This is an R Markdown document for the first peer assessment. 

## Loading and preprocessing the data 
Make sure to copy the input file activity.csv is copied to the working directory


```{r}
steps <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
